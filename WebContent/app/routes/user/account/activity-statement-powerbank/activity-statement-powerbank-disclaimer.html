        You are allocated virtual storage in a battery (based on the storage option selected either the 6kWh or 8kWh option) for electricity you export between the period of
        7am and 3pm (Storage Period) up to the Maximum Offset Quantity (based on your storage option). There is no physical battery connected to your premises storing
        your electricity. Once the Maximum Offset Quantity has been reached, you will be paid the Solar Energy Buyback Rate for additional electricity you exported.
        Virtually stored electricity will be used to offset consumption in accordance with the Offset mechanism in the Power Bank Saver terms and conditions.

        Usage and export data displayed is based on actual usage. If data is unavailable for any graph or table in respect of any time period, the respective graph or table
        will not display any data.

        ^Representations as to savings are calculated by comparing the charges you have incurred on the PowerBank Saver Plan against the charges you would have
        incurred on the Home Plan (A1) based on the metering data received by Synergy for your premises for the selected period or stated period.
