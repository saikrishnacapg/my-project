        <div class="form-group" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;  "><span><b>What happens if I do not use all of the energy I store in the battery during the day?</b> <br>
               At midnight every day your stored energy allocation resets to 0kW. Any excess energy that is not consumed will be purchased from you as normal at the Solar Energy Buyback Rate (which has the same rate as the Renewable Energy Buyback Scheme (REBS)) and show as a credit on your Synergy bill.
