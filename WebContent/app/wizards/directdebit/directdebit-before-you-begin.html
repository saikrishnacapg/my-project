    Direct Debit is a convenient, hassle-free way to pay your Synergy bills. If you choose to register for Direct Debit, the Total Due amount on your Synergy bill will be automatically deducted from your credit card* or bank account on the due date â€“ so your bills are paid on time, every time.

    To set up Direct Debit from your bank account you will need your BSB number, account number and account name. If you would like to use your debit or credit card* you will need to provide the name on the card, your credit or debit card number and the card's expiry date.
