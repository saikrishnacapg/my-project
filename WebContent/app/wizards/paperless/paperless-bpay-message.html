                We noticed that you're currently registered for BPAY view. This means we deliver your bills to your online banking portal instead.
                We also send any other account notifications to your mailing address. If you'd prefer to switch to the convenience of paperless,
                 you'll need to contact your financial institution and cancel BPAY view first.
