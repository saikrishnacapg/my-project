                New technical requirements for connecting and operating distributed energy systems that involve a
                small renewable energy system (solar systems) to the Western Power distribution network are changing.
                New solar systems from 14 February 2022 will be required to meet new

                In an emergency solar management event, new and upgraded residential rooftop solar systems
                with an inverter capacity of 5kVA or less must have the capability to be remotely turned off where a:

                <li>Synergy distributed energy buyback scheme application is received before 14 February 2022 and installed on or after 14 March 2022.</li>

                Talk to your solar provider about how these changes impact your
                solar system requirements and what is required to ensure your system meets the
