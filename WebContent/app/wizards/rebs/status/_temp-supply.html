    <p>Unfortunately we&rsquo;re unable to proceed with your application. Our records indicate that the selected meter is only a temporary connection and will be removed once construction on your property is complete.  You&rsquo;ll be able to apply for DEBS as soon as the permanent meter is installed.</p>
